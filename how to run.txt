HOW TO RUN YOUR ENCRYPTOR APP (DEVELOPMENT MODE)

This document explains how to start your React frontend and Python backend
so they can communicate during development.

==============================================================

STEP 1: START THE PYTHON BACKEND SERVER

1.  Open a NEW terminal or command prompt window.

2.  Navigate to your backend project folder:
    cd SnapCryptor/backend/

3.  Activate your Python virtual environment:
    * On Windows (Command Prompt):
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
    * On Windows (PowerShell):
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    * On macOS/Linux:
        source venv/bin/activate
    (You should see "(venv)" at the start of your terminal prompt once activated.)

4.  Start the Flask server:
    python app.py

    You should see output similar to:
    " * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"
    Leave this terminal window open and running.

==============================================================

STEP 2: START THE REACT FRONTEND APP

1.  Open ANOTHER NEW terminal or command prompt window.
    (You should now have two terminals open).

2.  Navigate to your frontend project folder:
    cd SnapCryptor/snapcryptorGUI/

3.  Start the React development server:
    npm start

    This will usually open your web browser automatically to:
    http://localhost:3000
    Leave this terminal window open and running.

==============================================================

YOU ARE NOW READY TO USE THE APP

* Your React frontend (GUI) is running in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
* Your Python backend (encryption logic) is running locally in the background on http://127.0.0.1:5000.
* The frontend will send requests to this local backend.

To stop both:
* Go to each terminal window and press `CTRL + C` (or `Cmd + C` on Mac) to stop the running processes.
* To deactivate the Python virtual environment in its terminal, simply type `deactivate` and press Enter.
